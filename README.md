# Relaxation-assisted reverse annealing on nonnegative/binary matrix factorization

This repository provides the code corresponding to the paper “Relaxation-Assisted Reverse Annealing on Nonnegative/Binary Matrix Factorization” by Renichiro Haba, Masayuki Ohzeki, and Kazuyuki Tanaka.

## Requirements

1. Install dependencies using poetry
```bash
poetry install
```
2. Store the data in the `data` directory via the link in the reference section of the paper.

## Usage

The file main.py serves as the primary script for running the experiments. It contains Jupyter-style “percent” directives, allowing you to execute each cell independently. Simply run the cells as needed to reproduce the experiments.
